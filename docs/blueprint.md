# **App Name**: Art Institute Explorer

## Core Features:

- Artwork Table Display: Display artworks fetched from the Art Institute of Chicago API in a PrimeReact DataTable.
- Server-Side Pagination: Implement server-side pagination to fetch artwork data for the current page from the API.
- Row Selection: Allow users to select rows in the table using checkboxes.
- Custom Row Selection Panel: Add a custom panel for row selection to persist selected/unselected rows across different pages.
- Data Persistence: Ensure row selections persist when navigating between pages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke a sense of calm and exploration.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, to provide a neutral backdrop for the artwork data.
- Accent color: A gentle lavender (#E6E6FA) to highlight selected rows and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern and neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons for UI elements like pagination controls and selection checkboxes to maintain a clean and unobtrusive aesthetic.
- Ensure adequate spacing and padding in the DataTable to maintain readability and visual clarity.
- Subtle transitions on row hover and selection to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
